# Coin flip

### Basic coin flip : 
Create a simple programme to simulate a coin flip. Ask the user if hey would like to pick heads or tails. Use random to do a coin flip. If the coin flip matches what the user said, print a message telling them that they have won. Else print a message telling the user they have lost
