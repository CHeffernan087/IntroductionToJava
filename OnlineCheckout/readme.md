# Online Checkout

Often times when we go to pay for goods online, we will get the choice if we would like to pay in euros or some other currency

Write a simple programme which will ask the user if they would like to pay in euros or pounds and print out the price they will be charged based on their answer. 
- This can all be done inside of a mainline (no need to write extra classes)
- Store the checkoutTotal and exchangeRate as variables in your programme
- Ask the user if they want to pay in pounds or euros
- Based on what the user answers, print out the price they will pay either in the correct currency
